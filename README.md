# SEPftSETA

**Stealth Engagement Platform for Tracking Social Engineering Threat Actors**  
_A red team–inspired adversary engagement project_

---

## Overview

SEPftSETA is a cybersecurity research project focused on the passive collection, analysis, and documentation of unsolicited scam and phishing interactions. Designed with operational security in mind, this platform leverages anonymized infrastructure, VPN chaining, and OSINT techniques to safely observe threat actor tactics without exposing personal identity or initiating offensive action.

## Objectives

- Deploy a hardened, anonymized burner phone environment
- Route communications through a chained VPN + jump server infrastructure
- Capture and log SMS, call metadata, and scam links sent to bait endpoints
- Perform passive DNS and HTTPS traffic analysis via isolated nodes
- Enrich collected data with OSINT and MITRE ATT&CK mapping
- Maintain ethical boundaries with no active probing or engagement
