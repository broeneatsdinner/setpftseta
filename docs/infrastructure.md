# Infrastructure Overview

This document outlines the abstracted infrastructure used in SEPftSETA, designed to support passive adversary engagement while maintaining operational security and anonymity.

---

## Infrastructure Goals

- Preserve anonymity during inbound scammer interactions
- Route all communications through obfuscated network layers
- Collect metadata and traffic safely, with no exposure of personal systems
- Maintain ethical, transparent logging boundaries
- Use custom-built VPN and jump server infrastructure to avoid exposure through shared or pre-configured environments
- Maintain full control over network stack, logging, and SSH configuration to minimize third-party risk

## Components

### üîê Burner Device
- A factory-reset iPhone 5
- Wi-Fi only ‚Äî no SIM, no Apple ID
- Connects exclusively over VPN

### üåê VPN Gateway (Midwest, US)
- WireGuard-based VPN server hosted on a US-based VPS
- SSH hardened: `PermitRootLogin no`, key-based auth only
- Hand-rolled VPS with hardened SSH configuration (no root login, no password auth)
- No templates or pre-configured VPN appliances used ‚Äî all setup and key generation performed manually
- Traffic encrypted and routed to jump server

### üõ´ Jump Server (Europe)
- Second VPS acting as the external-facing exit node
- Located in a privacy-conscious jurisdiction
- Hand-rolled and hardened, mirroring VPN gateway practices
- Traffic exits to VoIP provider and scammer-hosted infrastructure

### ‚òÅÔ∏è VoIP Platform
- Anonymous number obtained via masked identity
- VoIP app installed on burner device
- Used to receive SMS/calls from threat actors

## Security Practices

- Public key authentication only ‚Äî no password logins permitted
- No personally identifying usernames, hostnames, or comments in configuration
- Logs are collected on isolated systems with redacted metadata
- All IP addresses and providers abstracted in documentation and code

---

## Optional Future Enhancements

- DNS and HTTPS logging on jump server via `tcpdump` or `mitmproxy`
- Cowrie or Dionaea honeypot deployment behind jump server
- Reverse shell endpoint infrastructure (for future adversary interaction research)

All infrastructure was created for academic purposes and remains within the bounds of ethical passive collection. No offensive or unauthorized activities are conducted through this system.
